Hi, I'm Ryan.  I'm an engineer with a passion for data.  I'm currently encrolled in [General Assembly](https://generalassemb.ly/)'s Data Science Immersive Program in New York City.  Before that I was working as a senior mechanical engineer at Schlumberger's Princeton Technology Center in Princeton, New Jersey.
