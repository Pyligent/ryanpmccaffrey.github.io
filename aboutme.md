Hi, I'm Ryan, an engineer with a passion for data.  I'm currently enrolled in [General Assembly](https://generalassemb.ly/)'s Data Science Immersive Program in New York City.  Before that I was working as a senior mechanical engineer at [Schlumberger](http://www.slb.com/)'s Princeton Technology Center in Princeton, New Jersey.  In that role I carried out design and process improvements on various nuclear technologies (primarily neutron generators, sometimes detectors), which are used to measure and evaluate different geological formations deep below the Earth's surface in an effort to find oil.
