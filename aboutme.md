Hi, I'm Ryan, an engineer with a passion for machine learning and data science.  I'm currently enrolled in [General Assembly](https://generalassemb.ly/)'s Data Science Immersive Program in New York City.  Before that I was a senior mechanical engineer at [Schlumberger](http://www.slb.com/)'s Princeton Technology Center in Princeton, New Jersey.  In that role I applied design and process improvements to various nuclear technologies (primarily neutron generators, sometimes detectors), which are used to measure and evaluate different geological formations deep below the Earth's surface in an effort to find oil.  

My data science tool of choice is currently Python (including numpy, pandas and scikit-learn).  In the past I have also used R in Kaggle competitions as well as MATLAB, which I used extensively in my coursework and research.
