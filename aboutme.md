Hi, I'm Ryan, an engineer with an interest machine learning, deep neural networks and data science.  I'm currently a data scientist at [Covance](https://www.covance.com/), a clinical trials research company.  Before that I was a senior mechanical engineer at [Schlumberger](http://www.slb.com/)'s Princeton Technology Center in Princeton, New Jersey.  In that role I applied design and process improvements to various nuclear technologies (primarily neutron generators, sometimes detectors), which are used to measure and evaluate different geological formations deep below the Earth's surface in an effort to find oil.  I also completed [General Assembly](https://generalassemb.ly/)'s Data Science Immersive Program in New York City.    

My data science tool of choice is currently Python (including pandas, numpy, scikit-learn and matplotlib).  In the past I have also used R in Kaggle competitions ([example](https://github.com/ryanpmccaffrey/Homesite)) as well as MATLAB, which I used extensively in my coursework and research ([example](https://github.com/ryanpmccaffrey/DVC)).  I also have experience with relational databases and big data distributed systems.
